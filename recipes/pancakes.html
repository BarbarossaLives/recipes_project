    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card,
        this was a family favorite.</p>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around
        delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much
        better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add
            milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
            using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to
            3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li>

    </ol>
